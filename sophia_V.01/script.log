2020-05-19 17:27:04,237 :  the crypto Bots are going well
2020-05-19 17:27:14,374 :  I'm going to keep them running and see if they turn a profit in the simulation based on real time date
2020-05-19 17:27:24,338 :  and we will see how that goes I don't really know if it will work but it's better than risking real money for it
2020-05-19 17:27:34,549 :  I can always start it up tomorrow if it starts working it just started raining which is really sad I haven't really been focusing on Muse
