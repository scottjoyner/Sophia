# Sophia
## Introdcution
Sophia is a dictation tool used for all those note takers out there who's brains seem to always be one step ahead of their pen or pencil. Currently Sophia will dictate whatever you say, and will play and pause music on spotify if you give her access to your account. 
## Future Developemnt 
Sophia is a work in progress designed to be a platform to create a virtual assistant that can undertsand natural language and allow for easy expandability for anyone who would like to customize their own personal assistant.
In the future I would like to move away from the google dictation api and eliminate that dependancy and mvoe towards an open source option that can be processed without having to connect to a remote server, https://cmusphinx.github.io/wiki/ seems to be a good place for me to start, but this is simply a work in progress.
